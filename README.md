# 🚜 Bulldozer Price Prediction Model

Welcome to the Bulldozer Price Prediction Model repository! This project aims to predict the prices of bulldozers using machine learning techniques.

## 🎯 Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** We've performed extensive data preprocessing, including:
  - Parsing dates to enrich the dataset with time and date features 📅.
  - Handling missing values in both numeric and categorical columns 🔍.
  - Converting categorical variables into numeric format using one-hot encoding 🔡.

- **Random Forest Regressor:** We've built a machine learning model using the Random Forest Regressor algorithm from scikit-learn. Some key features of the model include:
  - Parallel processing (n_jobs=-1) for faster training 🚀.
  - Setting a random seed (random_state=42) for reproducibility 🔒.

- **Model Evaluation:** We've evaluated the model using appropriate metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), to measure prediction accuracy 📈.

- **Test Data Processing:** We've created a function, `preprocess_data`, to preprocess test data, ensuring it's in the same format as the training dataset 🔄.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn

## 🏁 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine 🖥️.
2. Install the required Python packages using the following command:
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train the model and make predictions 🏃‍♀️.

## 🚀 How to Use

- Ensure you have the necessary data in the correct format (e.g., CSV files) 📃.
- Use the `preprocess_data` function to preprocess your test data before making predictions 🔄.
- Load the trained model and use it to predict bulldozer prices 💰.
- Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics 📏.
